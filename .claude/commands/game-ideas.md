Brainstorm new game ideas for Table Wars.

Consider the system architecture:
- PUCK: Shake, tilt, button press, LED feedback, buzzer
- TV: Full graphics, animations, 3D renders, videos
- SERVER: Game logic, physics, rendering

Generate 5-10 creative game concepts that:
1. Use puck's motion/input capabilities creatively
2. Have SICK TV graphics potential (not boring)
3. Work for the target markets (bars, senior living, corporate, fitness)
4. Are FUN and competitive
5. Are technically feasible with current hardware

For each game, describe:
- Name
- How puck is used (input method)
- What TV shows (visuals)
- Scoring system
- Why it's fun

Be creative. Think beyond simple button-mashing. Consider:
- Timing games
- Precision challenges
- Team coordination
- Strategic elements
- Unexpected mechanics
