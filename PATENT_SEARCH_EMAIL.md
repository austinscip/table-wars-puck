# Email to Patent Lawyer - Table Wars Patent Search

**Subject:** Patent Search Request - Interactive Bar Gaming Device

---

Hi [Lawyer's Name],

Thanks for offering to help with a patent search! Here's what I'm working on:

## QUICK OVERVIEW

**Product Name:** Table Wars
**What it is:** Interactive gaming puck system for bars/restaurants

**Think:** "Topgolf's ball tracking technology, but for drinking games at bars"

## THE DEVICE

A handheld circular puck (size of a hockey puck/coaster) containing:
- **Motion sensors** - Detects shaking, tapping, movement patterns
- **16 RGB LEDs** - Visual feedback, countdowns, animations
- **Physical button** - Speed/reflex testing
- **Dual wireless:**
  - Bluetooth → Mobile app controls it
  - WiFi → Sends scores to bar's server
- **Rechargeable battery** - USB-C charging

## HOW IT WORKS

1. Customer gets puck from bartender
2. Connects via phone app (Bluetooth)
3. Selects game mode (shake contest, speed tap, hot potato, etc.)
4. Puck tracks performance via sensors
5. Scores sent to bar's server via WiFi
6. Live leaderboards displayed on bar's TVs
7. Compete against other tables

## WHAT MAKES IT NOVEL

**Key innovations I think might be patentable:**

1. **Multi-puck venue network** - Multiple portable devices competing in real-time with centralized scoring
2. **Dual wireless architecture** - BLE for control + WiFi for data (unusual in battery device)
3. **Motion-based drinking game automation** - Using accelerometer/gyroscope for bar game scoring
4. **Specific game mechanics** - Shake intensity algorithms, tap speed detection, etc.
5. **System-level** - The whole ecosystem (pucks + server + displays + app)

## PRIOR ART CONCERNS

Things that might be similar:
- Wii controllers (motion gaming)
- Electronic dartboards (networked bar games)
- Topgolf (physical game tracking)
- Fitness trackers (motion sensors)
- Arcade networked systems (venue gaming)

**But we're different because:** Portable + battery-powered + bar-specific + multi-table networking

## WHAT I NEED

**Search objectives:**
1. Does anything like this already exist?
2. What's the closest prior art?
3. Which aspects are patentable?
4. Should we file a provisional ASAP?
5. Ballpark budget for provisional + utility patent?

**Timeline:**
- Have working prototypes (firmware + hardware done)
- Manufacturing prototypes arrive in 3-4 weeks
- Want "patent pending" before showing to investors/bars
- Planning soft launch in 3-6 months

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

If you want to dive deeper, I've attached a full 18-page technical brief with:
- Complete system architecture
- All 10 game mechanics
- Hardware specifications
- Software implementation details
- Patent class suggestions
- Detailed prior art analysis

**But for the initial search, the quick overview above should work!**

## QUESTIONS FOR YOU

1. Does this sound patentable to you?
2. What type of patent? (Utility, design, or both?)
3. Should I file provisional now, before prototypes ship?
4. Rough cost estimate for search + provisional filing?
5. Any red flags or concerns?

## SUPPORTING MATERIALS

I can provide:
- Full source code (firmware + server)
- Hardware schematics (PCB design)
- 3D case models
- Working prototype demo video
- System diagrams

**Attached:**
- `PATENT_SEARCH_BRIEF.md` - Detailed 18-page technical brief
- (Can send code/designs if needed)

**Let me know what you need to get started!**

Thanks,

## SUPER SHORT VERSION (If you want to text/message first)

"Hey! Got a product I'd love your patent opinion on:

**Table Wars** - Battery-powered gaming pucks for bars. Puck has motion sensors, LEDs, and dual wireless (BLE + WiFi). Players compete in physical games (shake contests, speed tapping, etc.), puck tracks scores and sends to bar's server for live TV leaderboards. Multiple pucks networked across tables.

Think: Topgolf tracking + Wii motion controls + bar entertainment.

Does this sound patentable? Worth a search?

I've got working prototypes, planning to manufacture in a few weeks. Want to get 'patent pending' before showing to investors.

Can you help with a search? What's your process/timeline/cost?

Let me know if you want the full technical writeup!"
