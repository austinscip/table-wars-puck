## IMPROVED PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

### **Primary Description (Broad - Use This):**

**"Interactive Competitive Gaming System"**

A networked system of portable electronic gaming devices that track physical interactions (shaking, tapping, movement patterns) through motion sensors, provide real-time visual and audio feedback via LEDs and sound, communicate wirelessly with mobile devices for control and with servers for score aggregation, and display competitive rankings across multiple simultaneous users on centralized displays. Designed for venues, events, and social gatherings where multiple participants engage in skill-based physical challenges.
