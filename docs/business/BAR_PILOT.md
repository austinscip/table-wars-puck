# TABLE WARS - Bar Pilot Deployment Guide

**Your roadmap to getting TABLE WARS into a real bar for testing.**

---

## 🎯 Pilot Goals

The goal of this pilot is to:
1. **Validate the concept** - Do people actually want to play?
2. **Test durability** - Can the pucks survive bar use?
3. **Gather feedback** - What games work? What doesn't?
4. **Capture content** - Get video footage for marketing
5. **Build relationships** - Establish your first customer

**Success = People playing voluntarily + positive feedback + viral video potential**

## 🎤 The Pitch

### Timing Your Approach

**Best time to pitch:**
- Early afternoon (2-4pm) when bar is quiet
- NOT during peak hours
- NOT on Friday/Saturday (too busy)
- Talk to owner/manager, not bartender

### The 30-Second Hook

*"Hey [Name], I'm [Your Name]. I've built this new bar game called TABLE WARS - it's like interactive electronic game pucks that people pass around the table. Think of it like a high-tech drinking game meets arcade. I'm looking for one bar to pilot it for free for 2-4 weeks. Would you be open to a 5-minute demo?"*

**Key points:**
- **FREE** for the pilot (they pay nothing)
- **Short commitment** (2-4 weeks)
- **No work for them** (you handle everything)
- **Ask for demo first** (don't oversell before showing)

### The Demo (If They Say Yes)

1. **Show the demo video** (30 seconds)
   - Pull it up on your phone
   - Let them see people playing
   - Show excitement/reactions

2. **Let them hold a puck**
   - Turn it on
   - Let them press button/shake it
   - Run through 2-3 games quickly
   - Make it interactive, not a lecture

3. **Explain the value**
   - *"People stay longer when they're having fun"*
   - *"It's Instagrammable - free marketing for you"*
   - *"Encourages group interaction, more drink orders"*
   - *"Bar vs Bar competition potential"*

4. **Address concerns preemptively**
   - **"What if someone breaks it?"** - *"They're pretty durable, and I'll swap out any broken ones immediately. I'm here to make sure it succeeds."*
   - **"What if people don't play?"** - *"That's what the pilot is for. If it doesn't work, I take them back, no hard feelings."*
   - **"How much?"** - *"Nothing for the pilot. I want your feedback. If you love it after 2-4 weeks, we can talk about a monthly fee."*

5. **Close with a specific ask**
   - *"Can I bring 6 pucks this Thursday night and set them up at one table?"*
   - *"I'll stay the whole night to explain the game and get feedback."*
   - *"Sound good?"*

### If They're Interested But Hesitant

**Offer a super low-commitment test:**
- *"How about I bring them just for one night - this Thursday from 7-11pm?"*
- *"I'll handle everything, and if people love it, we can do the full 2-week pilot."*
- *"If it flops, I take them home and we're done. No risk to you."*

### If They Say No

**Don't burn bridges:**
- *"No problem! If you hear about it working at another bar and change your mind, here's my number."*
- Leave your contact info
- Ask for referral: *"Do you know any other bar owners who might be interested?"*

## 📈 Post-Pilot Analysis

### Week 1 Debrief (After First Night)

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Did people play voluntarily?**
   - Yes = Great sign!
   - No = Need better hook/marketing

2. **How long did groups play?**
   - 20+ min = Solid engagement
   - 5-10 min = Games need work
   - < 5 min = Major redesign needed

3. **Technical issues?**
   - List every bug/failure
   - Fix before next session

4. **Which games worked best?**
   - Double down on winners
   - Cut or redesign losers

5. **Bar owner's reaction?**
   - Excited = Continue pilot
   - Neutral = Show data, push harder
   - Negative = Pivot or find new bar

### Week 2-4: Iterate & Improve

**Based on feedback:**
- [ ] Update firmware (fix bugs, tweak games)
- [ ] Improve instructions
- [ ] Add requested features
- [ ] Build more pucks if demand is high

## 💰 Pivot to Paid (If Pilot Succeeds)

### When to Bring Up Pricing

**Wait until:**
- Week 3-4 of pilot
- Bar owner has seen people playing regularly
- You have solid feedback/data
- People are asking "is this staying?"

### Proposed Pricing Models

**Option 1: Monthly Rental**
- $150-300/month for 6 pucks
- You maintain/update them
- They keep them at the bar

**Option 2: Revenue Share**
- Free rental
- Bar charges players ($5 per hour)
- You get 50% of revenue

**Option 3: Purchase**
- $500-800 one-time for 6 pucks
- Bar owns them
- You offer paid support ($50/month)

### The Pricing Pitch

*"So it's been [X weeks], and I've been hearing great feedback. People love it! I'm thinking of rolling this out to more bars. Would you want to keep the pucks here? I'm thinking $200/month for the set of 6, and I'll handle all updates and repairs. That's like $6-7 per night for a unique attraction that keeps people at your bar longer. Sound fair?"*

**If they hesitate:**
- Offer first month at 50% off
- Offer trial extension (one more month free)
- Ask what price would work for them

**If they say yes:**
- Get it in writing (simple one-page agreement)
- Set up recurring payment (Venmo/PayPal/Square)

### Pricing Conversation (Week 3-4)

**Text or in-person:**

---

Hey [Name], TABLE WARS has been going great! People seem to really love it. I've been thinking - would you want to keep it here permanently? I'm launching officially next month and want [Bar Name] to be one of my flagship locations.

I'm thinking $200/month for the 6 pucks, and I handle all repairs/updates. That's about $6 per night for a unique game that keeps people around longer.

First month would be half off ($100) since you helped me pilot it. Interested?
