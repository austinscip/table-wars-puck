# 💡 BONUS GAME IDEAS - Super Fun Additions

These are **original game concepts** I came up with that would be AMAZING additions to Table Wars:

---

## 🎮 TIER 1: SINGLE-PUCK PARTY GAMES

### 1. 🍺 CHUG TIMER

**Concept:** The puck IS your shot timer!

**How it works:**
- Puck starts pulsing green (GO!)
- Player picks up their drink
- Shake puck when you finish
- Faster chug = more LEDs light up
- Records your time

**Why it's GENIUS:**
- Ties directly into bar culture
- Creates instant competition
- Easy to film for social
- Scoreboard shows fastest chuggers
- Bar owners LOVE this (sells more drinks!)

**Scoring:**
- < 3 seconds: LEGEND (+1000)
- < 5 seconds: BEAST (+500)
- < 10 seconds: RESPECTABLE (+250)
- > 10 seconds: ROOKIE (+100)

### 2. 🎲 RANDOM CHALLENGE GENERATOR

**Concept:** Puck assigns YOU a random dare/challenge

**How it works:**
- Shake puck to randomize
- LED color reveals category:
  - 🔴 RED = Physical (pushups, dance, etc)
  - 🔵 BLUE = Mental (trivia, riddles)
  - 🟡 YELLOW = Social (compliment, joke, story)
  - 🟢 GREEN = Drinking (sip, chug, buy round)
  - 🟣 PURPLE = Wild Card (group decides)
- Number of LEDs = difficulty level
- Tap to accept, hold for 3s to pass (penalty)

**Why it's GENIUS:**
- Icebreaker at tables
- Keeps energy high
- Infinitely replayable
- Great for groups who just met
- Could integrate with an app later for actual challenges

### 3. ⚔️ SLAP BATTLE

**Concept:** Last person to slap the puck loses!

**How it works:**
- Puck sits in middle of table
- Counts down with pulsing (5-4-3-2-1)
- Random delay after countdown
- Suddenly goes GREEN + BEEP
- SLAP THE PUCK!
- Records reaction time
- Slowest person each round = eliminated

**Why it's GENIUS:**

### 4. 🎵 BEAT KEEPER

**Concept:** Can you keep a rhythm?

**How it works:**

- Miss a beat = game over

**Why it's GENIUS:**

### 5. 🔥 PRESSURE COOKER

**Concept:** How long can you resist pressing the button?

**How it works:**
- DON'T press the button!
- Puck gets angrier over time:
  - 0-10s: Calm blue
  - 10-20s: Yellow + slow pulse
  - 20-30s: Orange + fast pulse + occasional vibrate
  - 30-40s: RED + constant pulse + frequent vibration
  - 40-50s: CHAOS MODE (strobing + beeping + vibrating)
- Press button = you lose (but earn points for time survived)
- Make it to 60s = LEGENDARY

**Why it's GENIUS:**
- Psychological torture
