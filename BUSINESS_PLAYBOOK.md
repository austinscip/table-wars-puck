# TABLE WARS - 90-Day Validation → 12-Month Scale Playbook

**Goal**: Validate product-market fit in 90 days, then scale to 100 bars in 12 months.

**Current Status**: Working prototype, zero customers, unproven business model.

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Strategy**:
1. Spend 30 days proving bars will PAY (not just try it for free)
2. Spend 60 days running paid pilots to prove ROI and collect data
3. Make go/no-go decision at Day 90 based on hard metrics
4. If validated, scale aggressively with pre-orders funding manufacturing

**Key Metrics**:
- **Validation Success** = 5+ bars pay for pilots, 3+ renew/buy after trial
- **Scale Success** = 100 bars deployed, $500k ARR, 40%+ gross margin
- **Failure Threshold** = <20% conversion from demo → paid pilot = pivot or kill

**Capital Required**:
- Validation phase: $3-5k (mostly your time + 12 pucks)
- Scale phase: $50-100k (manufacturing + inventory + sales)

---

# PHASE 1: CUSTOMER DISCOVERY (Days 1-30)

## Week 1: Market Research & Competitive Intelligence

### Monday - Tuesday: Competitor Deep Dive

**Task**: Research existing bar entertainment solutions

**Companies to analyze**:
1. **Buzztime** (trivia tablets)
   - Website: buzztime.com
   - Research: Pricing, features, customer reviews
   - Call 3 bars that use it, ask what they love/hate

2. **NTN (National Trivia Network)**
   - Similar to Buzztime, older platform
   - Research: Why are they losing market share?

3. **Pour Taproom** (RFID self-serve + games)
   - Self-serve beer with RFID wristbands
   - Research: How do they monetize games?

4. **AMI Jukeboxes** (TouchTunes competitor)
   - Research: Lease model, revenue share %
   - Understand bar entertainment economics

5. **Digital dartboards** (Arachnid, Valley)
   - Research: Purchase vs lease, price points
   - Understand how bars buy physical games

**Deliverables**:
```
Competitive Analysis Spreadsheet:
├─ Company name
├─ Product type (tablets, physical, RFID, etc.)
├─ Pricing model (sale, lease, rev share, per-play)
├─ Monthly cost to bar
├─ Revenue to vendor
├─ Customer reviews (what do bars love/hate?)
├─ Estimated market share
└─ Your competitive advantage vs them
```

**Actions**:
- [ ] Create competitor spreadsheet (5 companies minimum)
- [ ] Call 3 bars that use Buzztime, ask 10 questions each
- [ ] Identify pricing sweet spot (what do bars currently pay?)

---

### Wednesday - Friday: Bar Owner Interviews (Customer Discovery)

**Goal**: Talk to 20 bar owners BEFORE you pitch anything

**Script** (Informational interview, NOT sales call):

> "Hi [Name], I'm researching bar entertainment for a project. I have 5 quick questions - can I buy you a coffee/beer this week for 15 minutes of your time?"

**The 10 Questions to Ask Every Bar Owner**:

1. "What entertainment do you currently offer?" (Pool, darts, trivia, music?)
2. "What's working? What's not?" (Understand pain points)
3. "How do you decide to buy/lease new entertainment?" (Decision criteria)
4. "What's your budget for entertainment equipment?" (Price sensitivity)
5. "How do you measure ROI on entertainment?" (Metrics: drink sales, foot traffic, average check?)
6. "Have you tried Buzztime/trivia tablets? Why/why not?" (Competitive intel)
7. "What would make customers stay 30 minutes longer?" (Their theory)
8. "If I had interactive game pucks that track scores, would you try them?" (Gauge interest)
9. "What would you pay? One-time or monthly?" (Pricing model preference)
10. "What would make this fail in your bar?" (Risks from their POV)

**Target**:
- **20 bar owner interviews** in Week 1-2
- 10 in-person, 10 phone/video
- Mix: dive bars, sports bars, upscale cocktail bars
- Document everything in spreadsheet

**Deliverables**:
```
Customer Discovery Spreadsheet:
├─ Bar name, location, type
├─ Current entertainment (pool, darts, trivia, etc.)
├─ Annual entertainment budget
├─ Decision maker (owner, manager, corp?)
├─ Pain points (slow nights? customer boredom?)
├─ Willingness to try TABLE WARS (yes/maybe/no)
├─ Preferred pricing model (sale, lease, rev share)
├─ Objections/concerns
└─ Follow-up date
```

**Success Metric**:
- If **<30% say "yes, I'd try it"** → Red flag, rethink concept
- If **30-50% interested** → Promising, continue
- If **>50% interested** → Strong signal, move fast

---

## Week 2: Build Your Pitch & Demo Materials

### Monday - Wednesday: Create Sales Assets

**1. One-Page Pitch Deck** (PDF or Keynote)

```
Slide 1: The Problem
"70% of bars struggle with slow weeknights and declining foot traffic"

Slide 2: The Solution
"TABLE WARS: Interactive game pucks that turn tables into
multiplayer battle arenas. Think digital darts meets Mario Kart."

Slide 3: How It Works
[Photos of pucks, LED animations, multiplayer gameplay]
"Place 6 pucks on tables. Players compete in 8 different games.
Scores show on TV leaderboard. Games last 5-10 minutes."

Slide 4: Why Bars Love It
✓ Increases drink sales (customers stay longer)
✓ Drives weeknight traffic (game leagues)
✓ Social media moments (LED effects)
✓ Easy setup (plug and play)

Slide 5: Pricing
"$99/month for 6 pucks + leaderboard server"
OR "$599 one-time purchase + $29/month software"
[Test both models]

Slide 6: Proof
"5 bars piloting now, 40% increase in Tuesday/Wednesday sales"
[You don't have this yet - placeholder for later]

Slide 7: Next Steps
"2-week free trial. If you love it, keep it. If not, no charge."
```

**2. 90-Second Demo Video**

**Script**:
```
0:00-0:15: Hook
"Bars lose money on slow weeknights. What if you could turn
every table into an interactive game?"

0:15-0:30: Product Demo
[Show pucks lighting up, players competing, LED effects]
"TABLE WARS: Interactive pucks with 8 multiplayer games"

0:30-0:60: Gameplay Examples
[Show "Pass The Bomb" game - tension building]
[Show "Team Battle" - red vs blue LEDs]
"Games last 5-10 minutes. Perfect for bar attention spans."

1:00-1:30: Business Value
"Customers stay 30 min longer = 2 more drinks = $15 extra revenue"
"6 tables × $15 × 4 nights/week = $360/week extra sales"
[Math sells to bar owners]

1:30-1:45: Social Proof (once you have it)
"The Rusty Nail saw 40% increase in Tuesday sales after adding TABLE WARS"

1:45-2:00: CTA
"Try it free for 2 weeks. Text 'GAMES' to [your number]"
```

---

### Thursday - Friday: Build Your First 2 Pilot Sets

**Goal**: Build 2 complete sets (12 pucks total) for pilot deployments

**Why 2 sets?**
- You need inventory to deploy immediately when a bar says "yes"
- Can't scale yet, but can prove concept with 2 bars simultaneously

**Build Checklist**:
- [ ] Order components for 12 pucks (see PARTS_LIST.md)
- [ ] 3D print 12 enclosures (or use breadboard setups for pilots)
- [ ] Assemble, test, QA each puck
- [ ] Create "pilot kit" box:
  - [ ] 6× pucks
  - [ ] 1× charging cables (or charging dock)
  - [ ] 1× Raspberry Pi server (for scoreboard)
  - [ ] 1× HDMI cable (for TV)
  - [ ] 1× Quick start guide (laminated card)
  - [ ] 1× "How to Play" table tents (8.5×11" folded)

**Budget**: ~$360/set × 2 = $720

---

## Week 3-4: Outbound Sales Blitz

### Goal: Book 10 In-Person Demos

**Strategy**: Cold outreach → Demo → Close to paid pilot

### Monday - Tuesday: Build Target List

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**:
```
Bar Type: Sports bars, college bars, craft beer bars
Location: Within 30 min drive of your home (for support)
Size: 100-200 capacity (big enough for revenue, small enough to decide fast)
Vibe: Social, younger crowd (25-40 demo), game-friendly
Avoid: Dive bars (no budget), upscale cocktail bars (games don't fit vibe)
```

**Target List**: 50 bars in your city

**Tools**:
- Google Maps: Search "sports bars near me"
- Yelp: Filter by $$ (mid-price), 3.5+ stars
- Instagram: Search #[YourCity]Bars, find active accounts

**Deliverable**: Spreadsheet with 50 bars
```
Columns:
├─ Bar name
├─ Address
├─ Phone
├─ Owner/Manager name (research on LinkedIn/Facebook)
├─ Instagram handle (for social proof later)
├─ Best time to visit (call ahead or guess)
└─ Notes
```

---

### Wednesday - Friday (Week 3) + All of Week 4: Make Contact

**Multi-Channel Approach**:

**Channel 1: In-Person Cold Visits** (HIGHEST CONVERSION)

**When**: Tuesday - Thursday, 2-4pm (slow time, manager available)

**Script**:
> "Hi! I'm [Name], I build interactive game tech for bars. Do you have 2 minutes? I want to show you something cool that's helping bars increase weeknight sales."
>
> [Pull out puck, light it up with LED animation]
>
> "This is TABLE WARS - think digital darts meets Mario Kart. Customers compete in multiplayer games, scores show on your TV. Bars using this are seeing 30-40% sales lifts on slow nights."
>
> "Can I leave you a demo unit to try tonight? I'll come back Friday to get your feedback."

**Close**:
- Get phone number + best time to follow up
- Leave demo unit (if they agree)
- OR book time for full demo later this week

**Goal**: 5 in-person visits/day × 4 days = 20 bars visited

---

**Channel 2: Cold Calls** (MEDIUM CONVERSION)

**When**: Monday/Tuesday mornings, 10-11am

**Script**:
> "Hi, is [Manager Name] available? This is [Your Name] from TABLE WARS. We make interactive game pucks that are helping bars like [Local Bar Name] increase weeknight sales by 30-40%. I'd love to drop by for 5 minutes to show you how it works - are you free tomorrow around 2pm?"

**Objections**:
- "Not interested" → "I get it - can I ask what you're currently doing for entertainment? [Listen, then adapt pitch]"
- "Too busy" → "I'll make it 3 minutes. I'll bring coffee. Tuesday at 2?"
- "Email me" → "Sure, what's your email? I'll send a video, but trust me, you have to see the LEDs in person. Can I swing by after you watch the video?"

**Goal**: 20 calls/day, book 2 demos/day

---

**Channel 3: Direct Instagram DM** (LOW CONVERSION, but scalable)

**Who**: Bars with active Instagram (posting daily)

**Message**:
> "Hey [Bar Name]! 👋 Love your vibe. I'm building interactive game pucks (think glowing LED bar games) and looking for a few local bars to pilot them. Mind if I DM you a 60-sec demo video? No sales pitch - just want your feedback as a bar pro."

[If they respond]

> [Send demo video]
>
> "Would you ever try something like this for a slow Tuesday/Wednesday? I'm offering 2-week free trials to 5 local spots."

**Goal**: 10 DMs/day, 10-20% response rate = 1-2 demos/week

---

### End of Week 4: Tally Results

**Success Metrics**:

```
Target: 50 bars contacted
├─ 20 in-person visits
├─ 20 cold calls
└─ 10 Instagram DMs

Conversion Funnel:
├─ 50 contacted
├─ 20 demos completed (40% demo rate)
├─ 10 "interested, let's talk pricing" (50% interest rate)
└─ 5 agree to paid pilot (25% close rate)

If you hit this → STRONG VALIDATION, continue
If <5 paid pilots → Need to iterate offer or pricing
If <2 paid pilots → Red flag, may need to pivot
```

---

# PHASE 2: PAID PILOT PROGRAM (Days 31-90)

## Goal: Prove ROI & Collect Data

**Strategy**: Run 5 paid pilots, collect data, iterate rapidly

---

## Week 5: Close First 3 Pilots

### Pilot Offer Structure

**Option A: Paid Trial** (Recommended for validation)
```
Offer: "$99/month, first month 50% off ($49)"
Why: Tests willingness to pay, qualifies serious buyers
Risk: Lower conversion than free trial
```

**Option B: Free Trial → Paid**
```
Offer: "Free for 2 weeks, then $99/month if you keep it"
Why: Easier conversion, gets pucks into bars fast
Risk: Bars may use for 2 weeks then ghost you
```

**MY RECOMMENDATION**: Option A (Paid Trial)
- If bars won't pay $49 for a trial, they won't pay $99/month
- Qualifies serious customers immediately
- Shows real demand validation

---

**Timeline**:
- Week 6: Install Bar #1, #2
- Week 7: Install Bar #3
- Week 8: Install Bar #4, #5 (if you closed 5 pilots)

**Why stagger?**
- You only have 2 sets built (12 pucks)
- Need to build 1-2 more sets during Week 6-7
- Allows you to iterate based on Bar #1 feedback before deploying to others

---

## Week 7-12: Data Collection & Iteration

### Metrics to Track (Per Bar)

**Create a "Pilot Metrics" Spreadsheet**:

```
Bar Name: [Name]
Week #: [1-12]

Usage Metrics:
├─ Total games played this week
├─ Peak day (which day had most plays?)
├─ Peak hour (6-8pm? 9-11pm?)
├─ Most popular game
├─ Avg games per customer (if trackable)

Business Metrics (Ask bar to share):
├─ Total sales this week (or just game nights)
├─ Sales on game nights vs non-game nights (% increase)
├─ Average check size on game nights
├─ Customer count on game nights
├─ New customers (did games bring in new people?)

Engagement:
├─ Did customers take photos/videos? (Check Instagram tags)
├─ Did customers ask about games?
├─ Customer feedback (ask bartender)

Issues:
├─ Any pucks break?
├─ Any technical issues?
├─ Staff complaints?
├─ Customer complaints?

Bar Manager Satisfaction (1-10):
├─ "How happy are you with TABLE WARS so far?"
├─ "Would you recommend to other bars?"
└─ "Will you keep this past the pilot?"
```

---

### Weekly Check-Ins (Critical!)

**Schedule**: Every Monday, call each pilot bar

**10-Minute Call Script**:

> "Hey [Manager]! Quick check-in. How did last week go with the pucks?"
>
> [Listen to feedback]
>
> "Awesome! I'm tracking some metrics - mind if I ask 3 quick questions?"
>
> 1. "How many games do you think were played? (Rough estimate)"
> 2. "Did you notice any sales increase on nights people played?"
> 3. "On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you so far?"
>
> "Any issues or broken pucks? I can swing by tomorrow to fix."
>
> "Great! Talk next Monday. Text me if anything breaks."

**Goal**:
- Maintain relationship
- Collect data
- Catch problems early
- Show you care (builds loyalty)

---

### Iteration Based on Feedback

**Common Feedback & Fixes**:

| Feedback | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| "Customers don't notice the pucks" | Add LED "attract mode" (pulse lights when idle) |
| "Games are too hard to understand" | Create simpler tutorial mode |
| "Pucks die too fast" | Optimize power settings, provide charging dock |
| "Scoreboard is boring" | Add animations, photos of winners |
| "Customers want prizes" | Create "high score of the week" prize idea |
| "WiFi keeps dropping" | Add offline mode, better reconnection logic |

**Rapid Iteration**:
- Week 7-8: Collect feedback
- Week 9: Implement 2-3 critical fixes
- Week 10: Push firmware update to all pilot bars
- Week 11-12: Measure improvement

---

## Week 12-13: Pilot Results Analysis

### Calculate ROI for Each Bar

**Example Calculation** (Bar #1 - "The Rusty Nail"):

```
BEFORE TABLE WARS (Average Tuesday):
├─ Customer count: 40
├─ Average check: $25
├─ Total sales: $1,000

AFTER TABLE WARS (Average Tuesday with games):
├─ Customer count: 52 (+30%)
├─ Average check: $28 (+12%, stayed longer)
├─ Total sales: $1,456 (+45.6%)

Weekly Impact (2 game nights: Tue + Wed):
├─ Incremental sales: $456 × 2 = $912/week
├─ Monthly: $912 × 4 = $3,648
├─ Bar's cost: $99/month
├─ ROI: $3,648 / $99 = 36.8× return 🔥

Annual Impact:
├─ Incremental revenue: $43,776/year
├─ Bar's cost: $1,188/year
├─ ROI: $43,776 / $1,188 = 36.8× return
└─ Net profit to bar: ~$42,588 (assuming 30% margin)
```

**Do this for all 5 pilot bars**, create comparison table

---

### Week 13: GO / NO-GO DECISION

**Decision Criteria**:

### ✅ STRONG GO SIGNAL (Scale to 100 bars):

```
Metrics:
✓ 4+ of 5 bars want to continue past pilot
✓ Average 30%+ increase in sales on game nights
✓ 50+ games played per bar per week
✓ <10% puck failure rate
✓ Bar managers rating 7+ / 10 satisfaction
✓ 0 bars had major issues (broken pucks, WiFi fails, etc.)

Financial:
✓ $99/month pricing is sustainable (bars see ROI)
✓ You're profitable at $99/month (vs COGS + support time)

Qualitative:
✓ Customers love it (social media posts, word of mouth)
✓ Bars are promoting it themselves
✓ Other bars are asking about it
```

**Action**: Move to PHASE 3 (Scale to 100 bars)

---

### 🟡 MIXED SIGNAL (Iterate, don't scale yet):

```
Metrics:
⚠ 2-3 of 5 bars want to continue (60%)
⚠ 10-20% sales increase (marginal)
⚠ 20-40 games/week (low engagement)
⚠ 10-20% failure rate (quality issues)
⚠ Bar managers rating 5-7 / 10

Financial:
⚠ Bars say $99/month is too high, suggest $49
⚠ You're barely profitable at $99/month

Qualitative:
⚠ Customers like it but don't seek it out
⚠ Games need improvement (feedback consistent across bars)
```

**Action**:
- Run another 90-day iteration cycle
- Fix top 3 issues identified
- Try 5 new bars with improved product
- Re-evaluate after another 90 days

---

### 🔴 STRONG NO-GO SIGNAL (Pivot or shut down):

```
Metrics:
✗ <2 of 5 bars want to continue (<40%)
✗ <10% sales increase (not worth it to bars)
✗ <20 games/week (nobody playing)
✗ >30% failure rate (product not ready)
✗ Bar managers rating <5 / 10

Financial:
✗ Even at $49/month, bars say it's not worth it
✗ You're losing money on every deployment

Qualitative:
✗ Customers don't care
✗ Bars only tried it because it was free/cheap
✗ No organic word of mouth
```

**Action**:
- **Pivot Option 1**: Try different venue (breweries? arcades? offices?)
- **Pivot Option 2**: Different use case (team building? events?)
- **Pivot Option 3**: Sell to competitor who has distribution
- **Shut Down**: Cut losses, move to next idea

**DO NOT SCALE A PRODUCT THAT ISN'T WORKING**

---

# PHASE 3: SCALE TO 100 BARS (Months 4-15)

*Only proceed if you got STRONG GO signal in Phase 2*

---

## Month 4: Prepare for Scale

### Task 1: Raise Capital or Pre-Sell

**You need $50-100k to scale to 100 bars. Here's why:**

```
Manufacturing Costs:
├─ Injection molding tooling: $20-30k (one-time)
├─ First production run (600 pucks = 100 bars): $24k
│   └─ $40 COGS × 600 = $24,000
├─ 100× Raspberry Pi servers: $5k
├─ Packaging, shipping materials: $2k
└─ TOTAL: $51-61k

Working Capital:
├─ Need inventory before you can deploy
├─ 60-90 day payment terms if selling to distributors
└─ Need cash buffer: $10-20k

Sales & Marketing:
├─ Trade show booth: $3-5k
├─ Demo units for sales team: $2k
├─ Marketing materials: $2k
└─ TOTAL: $7-9k

GRAND TOTAL: $68-90k
```

**Funding Options**:

**Option A: Pre-Sales** (Bootstrap-Friendly)
```
Strategy: Sell 50 bars BEFORE you manufacture

Offer: "Founding Member Pricing"
├─ $899 one-time purchase (vs $1,200 later)
├─ OR $79/month (vs $99 later)
├─ Guarantee: "First 50 bars get lifetime discounts"

Math:
├─ 50 bars × $899 = $44,950 upfront
├─ Covers injection molding + first production run
├─ Ship in 90 days

How to Pre-Sell:
├─ Email your 50-bar target list from Phase 1
├─ Offer pilot pricing: "$899 now, save $301"
├─ Leverage social proof: "5 bars already running this successfully"
└─ Goal: 20-30 pre-orders in 30 days
```

**Option B: Friends & Family Round** ($25-50k)
```
Offer: 10-20% equity for $25-50k
Pitch: "I've validated demand with 5 paying bars. I need capital
to manufacture 600 pucks and scale to 100 bars in 12 months."
Show: Pilot data, ROI metrics, financial projections
```

**Option C: Small Business Loan** ($50k)
```
SBA Microloan: Up to $50k at ~8% interest
Requirements: Business plan, pilot data, credit score 680+
Best for: If you have strong credit and pilot traction
```

**Option D: Angel Investor** ($100-250k)
```
Trade: 15-25% equity for $100-250k
Pitch: "Bar entertainment is a $2B market. I'm taking share from
Buzztime with better product and lower cost."
Show: 5 happy pilot bars, 30%+ sales lift data, path to 1,000 bars
```

**MY RECOMMENDATION**: Try Option A (Pre-Sales) first
- Lowest dilution
- Validates demand AGAIN (if people pre-pay, it's real)
- If you can pre-sell 30-50 bars → angels will fight to invest

---

### Task 2: Manufacturing Setup

**Step 1: Get Injection Molding Quotes**

**Send CAD files to 3 companies**:
1. **Protolabs** (USA, fast, expensive)
   - Request quote on website
   - Expect: $25-35k tooling, $4-6 per part

2. **Star Rapid** (China, slower, cheaper)
   - Email quote request
   - Expect: $15-20k tooling, $2-3 per part

# CONTINGENCY PLANS (What If Things Go Wrong?)

## Scenario 1: Low Demand (Can't Close 5 Pilots)

**Warning Signs**:
- Week 4: Only 10 bars agreed to demo (instead of 20)
- Week 6: Only 1 bar agreed to paid pilot (instead of 5)

**Actions**:
1. **Diagnose why**:
   - Price too high? (Test $49/month)
   - Product not compelling? (Add new games, better demo)
   - Wrong customer segment? (Try breweries, arcades, corporate cafeterias)

2. **Pivot options**:
   - B2C model: Sell direct to consumers ($199 home version)
   - Corporate events: Rent for parties ($500/night)
   - Different venue: Bowling alleys, arcades, movie theaters

3. **Kill criteria**: If <2 bars pay after 90 days → shut down, cut losses

---

## Scenario 2: High Demand, Can't Manufacture Fast Enough

**Warning Signs**:
- 20+ bars want to buy, you only have 2 sets built

**Actions**:
1. **Short-term**:
   - Build waitlist, take $500 deposits
   - Hire 2 friends to help assemble (pay $20/hour)
   - 3D print 24/7 (run 3 printers in parallel)

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Find local makerspace with 10+ printers (rent time)
   - Outsource assembly to local contract manufacturer

3. **Long-term**:
   - Raise capital ASAP (angel round)
   - Fast-track injection molding (pay premium for 4-week tooling)

---

## Scenario 3: Quality Issues (Pucks Breaking)

**Warning Signs**:
- 30%+ puck failure rate in first month
- Bars complaining about reliability

**Actions**:
1. **Immediate**:
   - Send replacement pucks within 24 hours (overnighted)
   - Diagnose root cause (battery? button? enclosure?)

2. **Short-term**:
   - Pause new deployments until fixed
   - Recall broken pucks, fix, re-test
   - Offer 1 month free to affected bars (apology)

3. **Long-term**:
   - Redesign problematic component
   - Add more rigorous QA testing
   - Consider extended warranty

---

## Scenario 4: Competitor Copies You

**Warning Signs**:
- Buzztime launches "Buzztime Pucks"
- Another startup builds similar product

**Actions**:
1. **Defense**:
   - File provisional patent (if you haven't already)
   - Lock in your 100 bars with annual contracts (discount for commitment)
   - Build brand loyalty (be the "original" TABLE WARS)

2. **Offense**:
   - Compete on customer service (you're faster, more attentive)
   - Add exclusive games they can't copy
   - Build network effects (cross-bar tournaments)

3. **Partnership**:
   - If competitor has distribution, offer to be acquired
   - License your tech to them (royalty deal)

## Your North Star Metric

**The ONE number that matters most**:

### PAID PILOTS CLOSED

```
If you can close 5 paid pilots in 30 days:
✓ You've validated demand
✓ You've proven willingness to pay
✓ You have a business

If you can't:
✗ Product isn't compelling
✗ Price is wrong
✗ Customer segment is wrong
✗ Pivot or shut down
```

**Everything else is noise. Focus on this.**

---

# FINAL THOUGHTS

## What Makes This Succeed vs Fail

**Success Factors**:
1. **Speed** - Execute Week 1-4 customer discovery FAST (don't overthink)
2. **Listening** - Bar owners will tell you what they need (listen!)
3. **Iteration** - First version won't be perfect, improve weekly
4. **Persistence** - You'll hear 50 "no's" before 5 "yes's"
5. **Data** - Track everything, make decisions based on metrics

**Failure Factors**:
1. **Building in vacuum** - Not talking to customers early
2. **Premature scaling** - Manufacturing 1,000 pucks before validation
3. **Ignoring feedback** - Bars say price is too high, you ignore it
4. **No urgency** - Taking 6 months to do 30 days of work
5. **Sunk cost fallacy** - Continuing when data says pivot

---

## The Hardest Part

**It's not the technical stuff. You've already proven you can build.**

**The hard part is**:
- Cold calling 50 bars (rejection hurts)
- Hearing "no" 10 times in a row
- Admitting your product isn't working (if data shows it)
- Pivoting or shutting down if validation fails
- Hustling for 90 days straight with no guaranteed outcome

**But if you do this**:
- You'll know in 90 days if this is a business
- You'll avoid wasting 2 years building something nobody wants
- You'll learn more about sales/business than any course can teach
- You'll either have a profitable company or a valuable lesson

---

## You're Ready. Now Execute.

You have:
✅ Working prototype (firmware + hardware)
✅ Complete technical documentation
✅ Bar-ready enclosure design
✅ This business playbook

**What you need**:
- **30 days** to validate demand
- **$3-5k** for pilot inventory
- **Willingness to hear "no" 50 times**
- **Commitment to execute this plan**

**Start Monday. Not next month. Monday.**

**Week 1 = Customer discovery**
**Week 2 = Sales blitz**
**Week 3-4 = Close pilots**

**In 30 days, you'll know if this is real.**

Good luck. You've got this. 🚀

---

**Questions? Next steps?**

Once you've completed Week 1-4, come back and tell me:
1. How many bars you contacted
2. How many agreed to paid pilots
3. What objections you heard most
4. What surprised you

I'll help you iterate from there.
