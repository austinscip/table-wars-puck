# QUESTION STYLE BREAKDOWN - Indirect vs Direct

## WHAT IS "GANGRENE-STYLE" INDIRECT QUESTIONING?

**Gangrene Example (INDIRECT):**
- Setup: "Your dad stepped on a rusty nail 3 days ago. Now his leg is turning black and smells like death."
- Question: **"What's your move?"** ← Puts YOU in the scenario
- NOT asking: "What is the medical treatment for gangrene?" ← Direct factual

**Key Elements:**
1. Scenario-based setup (you're IN the situation)
2. Asks what YOU would do ("What's your move?", "What do you do?")
3. Implies the answer indirectly
4. More engaging/immersive

## WHY THE MIX?

You asked for:
1. ✅ Mix of absurd AND educational
2. ✅ Mix of easy/medium/hard difficulty
3. ✅ All with clear correct answers

**Reasoning:**
- **Easy questions** work better as DIRECT (Mars is red planet, 6 guitar strings)
- **Medium/Hard questions** work better as INDIRECT (gangrene scenario, sinking car)
- **General Knowledge category** is inherently more direct
- **Ways to Die / Medical Malpractice** are inherently more scenario-based

**If you want MORE indirect questions:**
I can rewrite the direct ones into scenario format:

❌ Direct: "What does HTTP stand for?"
✅ Indirect: "You're building a website and your boss asks what protocol browsers use to talk to servers. What do you tell her?"

❌ Direct: "How many bones does an adult have?"
✅ Indirect: "You're in med school. The professor points to a skeleton and asks how many bones you'll need to memorize. What's the answer?"

## RECOMMENDATION

**Keep the current 73/27 split** because:

1. **Variety prevents fatigue** - All indirect gets exhausting
2. **Easy questions need direct format** - "Mars is red planet" doesn't need a scenario
3. **Pacing matters** - Direct questions are faster (important for 20-min sessions)
4. **Different game types** - "Speed Pyramid" works better with quick direct questions

**OR**

**Go 90% indirect** by rewriting all General Knowledge and easy questions into scenarios (I can do this if you want)

**Your call:** Keep current mix or make it more indirect?
