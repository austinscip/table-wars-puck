WHAT'S STILL NEEDED
=============================================================================

TECHNICAL
1. 34 more trivia game engines (Category Royale, etc. need full implementation)
2. 466 more YDKJ questions (have 34, need 500 total)
3. Voice commentary (ElevenLabs integration for host voice)

3. Insurance (product liability)
4. Manufacturing partner (contract manufacturer for 100+ units)
5. Sales team (1 sales rep to start)
6. Marketing materials (demo videos, sales deck)
7. Pilot venue agreements (5 beta locations)

FINANCIAL
1. Seed funding ($50-100K to complete buildout)
2. Inventory financing (first 50 units = $15K)
3. Working capital (runway for sales cycle)

=============================================================================
KEY METRICS TO TRACK
=============================================================================

PRODUCT METRICS
- Session length (target: 20 min average)
- Repeat play rate (target: 60%+ return within 7 days)
- Game completion rate (target: 85%+ finish all 3 rounds)
- Favorite game types (data-driven content roadmap)
- Puck uptime/reliability (target: 99%+)

BUSINESS METRICS
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio (target: 3:1 minimum)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Churn rate (target: <5% monthly)
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) - venues + end users
- Revenue per venue
- Gross margin (target: 70%+)

BAR IMPACT METRICS (The Selling Point)
- Average ticket increase (target: +30%)
- Dwell time increase (target: +45 min)
- Return visit rate
- Table occupancy rate
- Social media mentions/UGC

=============================================================================
BIGGEST RISKS & MITIGATION
=============================================================================

RISK 1: Hardware Failure in Bar Environment
- Mitigation: Ruggedized design, warranty program, rapid replacement
- Cost: 10% buffer for warranty replacements

RISK 2: Bars Don't Want to Pay Subscription
- Mitigation: Free trial period, performance guarantees (increase sales or money back)
- Backup: One-time purchase option (higher upfront cost)

RISK 3: Content Gets Stale (Question Fatigue)
- Mitigation: Monthly question pack releases, user-generated content, seasonal updates
- Investment: Hire part-time writers ($2K/mo)

RISK 4: Can't Compete with Phones
- Mitigation: Enforce "no phones" during games, gamify social engagement
- Data: Bars report 40% less phone usage during active games

RISK 5: Manufacturing Delays/Quality Issues
- Mitigation: Start with small batches (10 units), local assembly, quality testing protocol
- Partner: Work with US-based contract manufacturer

RISK 6: Licensing/Legal (Jackbox Similarities)
- Mitigation: Original game mechanics, different hardware platform, consult IP attorney
- Cost: $10K legal budget

=============================================================================
UNFAIR ADVANTAGES
=============================================================================

1. Physical Hardware Moat - Harder to copy than pure software
2. Captive Audience - Bars control the environment (can't just download an app)
3. Network Effects - Bar vs Bar competitions create stickiness
4. Data Flywheel - More venues = more gameplay data = better game design
5. Content Library - 500+ questions becomes valuable IP over time
6. First Mover - No direct competitor in "gaming puck for bars" space

=============================================================================
BRAND IDENTITY
=============================================================================

Name: TABLE WARS
Tagline: "Battle at Your Table"
Voice: Irreverent, competitive, bar-friendly (like YDKJ meets ESPN)
Design: Bold colors, neon aesthetics, retro arcade vibes
Mascot: (TBD - possibly an angry hockey puck character)

=============================================================================
QUESTIONS FOR AI EVALUATOR
=============================================================================

Please analyze and provide feedback on:

1. BUSINESS MODEL VIABILITY - Is the B2B SaaS + hardware model sound?

2. MARKET SIZING - Are we targeting the right venues? What are we missing?

3. PRICING - Is $1,000/6-pack + $150/mo subscription realistic?

4. TECH STACK - Any red flags in our architecture?

5. COMPETITIVE POSITION - How do we truly differentiate from Buzztime/Jackbox?

6. GO-TO-MARKET - Is the pilot to regional to national plan feasible?

7. BIGGEST RISKS - What are we not seeing?

8. FUNDING NEEDS - How much capital to reach profitability?

9. UNIT ECONOMICS - Do our margins make sense?

10. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT - Will bars actually pay for this?

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
- Should we focus on bars exclusively or diversify early?
- Is hardware sale + subscription the right model, or go pure SaaS?
- How do we prevent bars from buying hardware then canceling subscription?
- What's a realistic Year 1 venue target? (We said 100)
- Should we build in-house or outsource manufacturing?
