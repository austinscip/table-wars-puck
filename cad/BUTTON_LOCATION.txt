TACTILE BUTTON LOCATION & ASSEMBLY
=====================================

WHERE THE BUTTON GOES:
----------------------

1. BUTTON TOWER (in bottom shell):
   - Location: EXACT CENTER of bottom shell (0, 0)
   - Shape: Circular tower, 20mm diameter
   - Height: 10mm tall from base (starts at 2.5mm base)
   - Top of tower: 12.5mm from absolute bottom

2. TACTILE BUTTON MOUNT:
   - Mounts ON TOP of the button tower
   - Two M2 screw holes in tower top
   - Button sits at ~12.5mm height
   - Button stem extends upward ~5-8mm

3. BUTTON CAP (separate piece):
   - 15mm diameter decorative cap
   - 3mm pin underneath contacts button stem
   - Sits at top shell interior
   - User presses DOWN through 12mm hole in top shell

4. TOP SHELL BUTTON HOLE:
   - Location: EXACT CENTER of top shell
   - Diameter: 12mm hole (clearance for button cap)
   - User's finger/thumb presses through this hole


HOW IT ASSEMBLES:
-----------------

[TOP SHELL]
    |
    | 12mm hole in center
    |
    v
[BUTTON CAP] ← decorative Forerunner glyph, user presses this
    |
    | 3mm pin
    |
    v
[TACTILE BUTTON] ← 12×12mm tactile switch, makes "click"
    |
    | mounted with M2 screws
    |
    v
[BUTTON TOWER] ← 20mm circular post in bottom shell
    |
[BOTTOM SHELL BASE]


WIRE ROUTING ISSUE:
-------------------

LED Ring wire needs to go from:
- LED ring (in top shell, 53mm diameter)
  DOWN through center
- To ESP32 (in bottom shell)

But button tower is IN THE WAY at center!

Current wire path:
LED ring → goes around button tower → to ESP32

Better solution:
- Hollow button tower (already done ✅)
- Wire routes THROUGH the hollow tower


GAMEPLAY PERSPECTIVE:
---------------------

When holding the puck:
- Thumb naturally rests on top center
- Button is RIGHT where thumb is ✅
- Press = tactile click feedback
- Can press while shaking/moving puck

Single button input types:
1. Single tap
2. Double tap
3. Triple tap
4. Long press (hold)
5. Press while shaking
6. Rapid tapping


FOR YOUR 37 GAMES:
------------------

Examples of button usage:
- "Avoid" game: Hold button to activate shield
- "Quickdraw" game: First to press button wins
- "Memory" game: Press to select color sequence
- "Hot Potato": Pass puck, press to "defuse"
- "Rhythm" game: Press in time with LED flashes

Question: Do ANY of your 37 games need TWO buttons?
If yes, we need to add a second button location.


BUTTON PLACEMENT OPTIONS:
--------------------------

Option A (CURRENT): Single center button
- Pro: Easy thumb access, intuitive
- Con: Only one input

Option B: Center + Side button
- Center: Primary action
- Side: Secondary action (on rim at 45° angle)
- Pro: Two-button games possible
- Con: Harder to press side button while holding

Option C: Two side buttons (opposite sides)
- Pro: Ambidextrous, two-handed games
- Con: No center button, less intuitive


TACTILE BUTTON SPECS:
---------------------

Typical tactile button:
- Size: 12×12mm (with through-hole legs)
- Travel: 0.5mm to actuation
- Force: 160-260gf (medium tactile)
- Life: 1 million actuations
- Mounting: PCB or small carrier board

Button cap adds:
- 2mm height above button
- Larger surface area (15mm vs 12mm)
- Forerunner aesthetic


YOUR CURRENT DESIGN:
--------------------

✅ Button is at CENTER (good for gameplay)
✅ Accessible through top shell hole
✅ Tactile feedback preserved
✅ Decorative cap looks good
⚠️ Only ONE button (verify this works for all 37 games)
⚠️ Button tower might interfere with wire routing (but it's hollow, so OK)


VERIFICATION NEEDED:
--------------------

1. Check your 37 games list - do ANY need 2+ buttons?
2. If yes, where should second button go?
3. Do you want button to be:
   - Center only (current)
   - Center + side
   - Other configuration?
